# Enhancing Customer Experience & Operational Efficiency at Westpac Group Contact Centres (RRB Division)

## Introduction

Westpac Group, comprising of brands, such as Westpac, St George, Bank of Melbourne, and BankSA, remains committed to delivering exceptional customer service and achieving industry-leading Net Promoter Scores (NPS). Westpac Group aims to lead the Australian banking sector in customer satisfaction by targeting the highest NPS score among competitors in both consumer and business banking by 2029 (Westpac, 2025). According to Westpac's 2025 Interim Financial Results 1H25, Westpac has ranked #2 for Consumer NPS and #3 for Business NPS. Additionally, the figure below obtined from Westpac Group 2025 Interim Results Presentation & Investor Discussion Pack, displays how Westpac has been tracking on NPS from March 2024 to March 2025, the figure portrays the following:

**1. Westpac (red line)**
- Started slightly negative (~0) in Mar-24.
- Gradually improved to ~+5 by Mar-25.
- This suggests a slow but steady uplift in customer advocacy.

**2. St.George Brands (dark blue line)**
- Consistently higher than both Westpac and peers throughout the year.
- Peaked above +10 mid-2024, dipped late 2024, then rebounded back near +10 by Mar-25.
- Indicates stronger customer sentiment for the regional brands compared to the Westpac brand.

**3. Peers (purple line)**
- Began higher than Westpac (~+7 in Mar-24).
- Declined through late 2024, dipping into negative territory (-5) by Mar-25.
- Suggests Westpac has gained relative ground versus competitors.

**Overall Message**
- Westpac brand improved modestly.
- St.George Brands clearly outperform — they’re a bright spot.
- Competitors’ scores fell, making Westpac/brands look better in relative terms.

Whilst these positive trends are great to see, 

As a contact centre representative within Westpac's Regional Retail Banking (RRB) division, I have identified several frequent, avoidable call drivers impacting efficiency, customer experience, and ultimately, Westpac’s NPS. Resolving these issues would reduce unnecessary calls, resulting in substantial cost savings and better customer satisfaction.

## Identified Problems & Recommendations

### 1. Digital Channel Limitations (Joint & Offset Account Openings)

**Problem:**  
Customers cannot open joint accounts or offset accounts online, a service readily offered by competitors such as UBank. Customers must contact the call centre, often resulting in multiple interactions due to both account holders needing simultaneous identification.

**Impact (Cost Calculation):**  
- Volume: 2 calls per agent/day × 10 agents × 5 days/week × 4 weeks/month = 400 calls/month  
- Deloitte estimate: $6 average cost per call  
- Estimated monthly cost: 400 × $6 = **$2,400/month** ($28,800 annually)

**Recommendation:**  
Implement a fully digital account-opening process for joint and offset accounts, leveraging online ID verification (as successfully utilised by UBank). This digital migration would reduce call volume substantially.

---

### 2. Misinterpreted Communications (Periodic Customer ID Verification)

**Problem:**  
Customers frequently ignore emails sent by the bank to verify their ID and update their contact details, as they perceive these emails to be scams. This leads to restricted accounts and unnecessary calls.

**Impact (Cost Calculation):**  
- Volume: 2 calls per agent/day × 10 agents × 5 days/week × 4 weeks/month = 400 calls/month  
- Estimated monthly cost: 400 × $6 = **$2,400/month** ($28,800 annually)

**Recommendation:**  
Introduce clear, secure, in-app notifications explicitly detailing why ID verification is required. This would reduce confusion and improve response rates. CBA, for instance, reported a 40% reduction in call centre wait times after strengthening in-app communications (CBA Annual Report, 2022).

---

### 3. App Interface Clarity (Pre-Maturity Instructions for Term Deposits)

**Problem:**  
Customers call for clarification on ambiguous notifications about pre-maturity instructions. Even after setting instructions, they are prompted again, resulting in repeated calls.

**Impact (Cost Calculation):**  
- Volume: 1 call/agent/day × 10 agents × 5 days/week × 4 weeks/month = 200 calls/month  
- Estimated monthly cost: 200 × $6 = **$1,200/month** ($14,400 annually)

**Recommendation:**  
Redesign the app notification system to confirm successful submission of instructions. Add explanatory text or video guides to reduce confusion and repeated contacts.

---

### 4. Poor App Navigation & Feature Discoverability

**Problem:**  
Customers struggle to locate important features such as Interim Statements or Financial Year Interest summaries. These features are often mislabelled or buried in menus.

**Impact (Cost Calculation):**  
- Volume: 2 calls/agent/day × 10 agents × 5 days/week × 4 weeks/month = 400 calls/month  
- Estimated monthly cost: 400 × $6 = **$2,400/month** ($28,800 annually)

**Recommendation:**  
Incorporate an AI-powered search function (e.g., like UBank’s Mia chatbot) to help customers navigate directly to features. Add video tutorials within the app for guidance.

---

### 5. Miscommunication on Replacement Cards

**Problem:**  
Customers mistakenly believe reporting a damaged card enables immediate digital replacement, as suggested by the website. In reality, a digital card often requires the physical card to be activated first, leading to dissatisfaction and follow-up calls.

**Impact (Cost Calculation):**  
- Volume: 1 call/agent/day × 10 agents × 5 days/week × 4 weeks/month = 200 calls/month  
- Estimated monthly cost: 200 × $6 = **$1,200/month** ($14,400 annually)

**Recommendation:**  
Clarify the replacement card process on all communication channels, ensuring consistent messaging across website, app, and contact centre.
