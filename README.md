# Enhancing Customer Experience & Operational Efficiency at Westpac Group Contact Centres (RRB Division)

## Introduction

Westpac Group, comprising of prominent brands including Westpac, St George, Bank of Melbourne, and BankSA, remains committed to delivering exceptional customer service and achieving industry-leading Net Promoter Scores (NPS). Westpac Group aims to lead the Australian banking sector in customer satisfaction by targeting the highest NPS score among competitors by 2029 (Westpac, 2025). However, currently, the Group trails behind certain competitors such as UBank, who provide streamlined digital offerings.

The average NPS for Australian banks in recent years hovered around +25 to +35, with digital leaders such as ING Direct and UBank significantly outperforming traditional banks including Westpac (Roy Morgan, 2023). Thus, addressing operational inefficiencies and digital shortcomings in customer interactions is crucial to Westpac's NPS goal.

As a contact centre representative within Westpac's Regional Retail Banking (RRB) division, I have identified several frequent, avoidable call drivers impacting efficiency, customer experience, and ultimately, Westpac’s NPS. Resolving these issues would reduce unnecessary calls, resulting in substantial cost savings and better customer satisfaction.

## Identified Problems & Recommendations

### 1. Digital Channel Limitations (Joint & Offset Account Openings)

**Problem:**  
Customers cannot open joint accounts or offset accounts online, a service readily offered by competitors such as UBank. Customers must contact the call centre, often resulting in multiple interactions due to both account holders needing simultaneous identification.

**Impact (Cost Calculation):**  
Volume: 2 calls per agent/day × 10 agents × 5 days/week × 4 weeks/month = **400 calls/month**  
Estimated monthly cost: 400 calls × $6 average call cost = **$2,400/month** ($28,800 annually)

> *Deloitte estimates average contact centre call cost in Australia between $5 to $7 (USD) per call (Deloitte, 2021).*

**Recommendation:**  
Implement a fully digital account-opening process for joint and offset accounts, leveraging online ID verification (as successfully utilised by UBank). This digital migration would reduce call volume substantially.

### 2. Misinterpreted Communications (Periodic Customer ID Verification)

**Problem:**  
Customers frequently ignore emails sent by the bank to verify their ID and update their contact details, as they perceive these emails to be scam emails, leading to restricted accounts and unnecessary calls.

**Impact (Cost Calculation):**  
Volume: 2 calls per agent/day × 10 agents × 5 days/week × 4 weeks/month = **400 calls/month**  
Estimated cost: 400 × $6 = **$2,400/month** ($28,800 annually)

**Recommendation:**  
Improve clarity in email communication by adding trusted branding and clear subject lines such as “Your Westpac account requires quick verification (2 mins)”. Additionally, introduce in-app push notifications and a banner message in digital banking interfaces.

---

### 3. Credit Card Misunderstandings (Payment Cycles & Interest)

**Problem:**  
Customers frequently call to understand how interest is applied on credit card balances, particularly after making repayments.

**Impact (Cost Calculation):**  
Volume: 1.5 calls/day × 10 agents × 5 days/week × 4 weeks/month = **300 calls/month**  
Estimated cost: 300 × $6 = **$1,800/month** ($21,600 annually)

**Recommendation:**  
Add simplified language and diagrams to monthly credit card statements (similar to CBA) showing how interest is applied and how to avoid it. Also include a quick “interest explainer” page in the mobile app.

---

### 4. Outdated Address Causing Returned Mail

**Problem:**  
Returned mail triggers internal investigations and customer calls. Many customers report they were unaware they needed to update both postal and residential addresses separately.

**Impact (Cost Calculation):**  
Volume: 1 call/day × 10 agents × 5 days/week × 4 weeks/month = **200 calls/month**  
Estimated cost: 200 × $6 = **$1,200/month** ($14,400 annually)

**Recommendation:**  
Change the UX on the online banking address update screen to clearly show both address types, and auto-select “use same address” unless customer changes it.

### Total Estimated Annual Cost of Avoidable Calls:
- Joint/Offset Accounts: $28,800
- Misinterpreted Emails: $28,800
- Credit Card Interest Confusion: $21,600
- Address Errors: $14,400  
**Total: $93,600**

If this analysis were extended to include 10 RRB teams nationwide, the annual cost could exceed **$900,000**, making process and CX improvements not just beneficial — but essential.
